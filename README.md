# Umm, what to do I guess...
So, umm I have literally no idea what I am doing. I recieved a miyoo mini plus, and tried learning a bit about it, and found that it has a wifi chip, so I looked up web browsers for this (thinking it must be possible to run one) and found that someone compiled lynx for the device, and I tried it out, and well, there is no javascript or ssl. Lynx runs old or stripped down websites, so I thought that maybe I'd somehow make my own or compile one for the miyoo to include some more modern things. I found Elinks, so I used Microsoft Copilot (I don't know how linux and stuff works lol) and installed WSL Ubuntu-24.04 and started compiling, and kinda successfully made this binary for it. My miyoo mini plus uses onion os, and I have only been able to run it by using the terminal (https://onionui.github.io/docs/apps/terminal) and I had it in the root of my microsd card, so to run it, I simply ran ./elinks-arm and it would launch. I see that Google.com has errors and just doesn't do anything, but duckduckgo.com runs just fine. I tried downloading an nes rom, and elinks just crashed... still kinda broken lol... I am sure that someone else can do this better though :D
